- the first couple of chapters really are boring
- go over the basics of html, css, and javascript

- examples in ch5 dont work
- googlemaps api has changed?

- chapter 6, ajax, xmlhttprequests and json
- good stuff
xmlhttprequests are good for getting files on your own server but they wont work cross server because of security issues

jsonp = using the script feature to load a json file from a different server using ?callback= to send the information retreived to a function
pg294
