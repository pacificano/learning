UX design process

phase 1 - determine users needs
phase 2 - develop user experience and information architecture design that meets needs
phase 3 - implement progressively
phase 4 - develop new capabilities



phase 1 - determine users needs

steps
- make shortlist of personas and user situations
- determine primary and secondary personas
- rank personas and users on relevance, frequency, and importance
- compare with current users

techniques
- interviews with stakeholders
- desk analysis (what are competition and industry doing)
- survey teachers, users and non-users
- interviews with users (~5)
- internal brain storm

deliverables
- list of personas and use cases, sorted by priority
- interview transcripts
- survey results

timeframe
- 2 weeks



phase 2 - develop user experience and information architecture design that meets needs

steps
- map out current content architecture
- combine interviews, design, and ideas into prototypes
- test prototypes with users -> iterate towards coherent, validated solution

techniques
- user interviews (~8 for each of the 3 personas)
- card sort information by priority
- wire framing
- user acceptance testing

deliverables
- sketches and paper prototypes
- testing materials
- sitemap and navigation architecture
- final wireframes and clickable prototype

timeframe
- 6 weeks



user experience process: research -> design -> iterate

research: identify key users, their needs, tasks they perform
design: create prototypes for design solutions, test with key users
iterate: modify designs after testing, validated final solution



information architecture: user flows -> information architecture

user flows: flow diagrams to show the ways users interact and search for content
information architecture: organise content into logical structure based on user needs



user journey
context -> user story -> product -> outcome

context: “i’m a teacher and need to teach a module i dont know”
user story: “i need worksheets from another teacher. i’ll email them. wait. i can find it on the website”
product: “hmm i cant search. but i can use my login. here it is. download”
outcome: “i got what i needed but that was frustrating”



typical UX design output
- card sorting for information architecture
- personas
- user flow
- wireframes



implement the solution progressively

steps
- work with stakeholders to understand resources and tech available
- prioritise implementation
- determine what metrics to monitor
- create roadmap which distributes roles and tasks

techniques
- stakeholder interviews
- sprint planning
- liaison with external parties as required

deliverables
- project plan
- product road-map
- list of tasks

timeframe
- 1 week



develop new capabilities (optional)

approach
- understand internal opportunities
- benchmark against similar offerings, best-in-class, and most innovative
- set high level objectives

techniques
- interviews with industry experts
- internal interviews

deliverables
- strategic presentation summarising opportunity and required resources
- high level plan focused around talent and management
- an advisory panel to accompany and facilitate the transition

timeframe
- 2 weeks
